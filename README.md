# **Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python**

## **Overview**
This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a console-based version of the classic game. The game keeps track of each player's score and allows multiple rounds of gameplay.

## **Features**
* **Console-Based Interaction:** Simple and clear output that allows players to choose positions on a 3x3 grid.
* **Score Tracking:** Scores for both players ('X' and 'O') are tracked and displayed after each game.
* **Multiple Rounds:** The game supports playing multiple rounds and tracks the number of rounds.
* **Replayability:** Players can choose to play again after each round.

## **How to Play**
Start the game by running the script.
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the position numbers (1-9) where you want to place your 'X' or 'O'.
The game board will update based on your input, and the turn will switch to the other player.
When a player wins, the game announces the winner and updates the score.
If the board is filled without any player winning, the game will declare it a draw and prompt for another round.

## **Requirements**
